#### Calculator
Scenario: we want buil a calculator with basic operation like sum and sub.

 To test the differences between the two approaches I tried to:

 + Add new operation % 
 + Add a new calc with programmer fetaures in which the % operator represent the module instead of percentage
 + Use custom operations
 + Add a composite operation (subtract the percentage)
